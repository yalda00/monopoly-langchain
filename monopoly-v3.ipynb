The base rent of 4 is low, but owning this property can help me acquire the entire brown set if I manage to buy the other brown property in the future. The brown properties are relatively low-cost investments, and owning them typically provides a good return on investment when developed. Given these factors, purchasing Whitechapel Road is a strategic move for future development and potential rent income.' decision='yes'\n",

The base rent of 6 is relatively low, but it is a light blue property, and owning multiple light blue properties can increase the rent significantly. Given that I have enough cash (1440) to buy it without affecting my liquidity, it is a strategic move to acquire it and potentially build upon it later.
